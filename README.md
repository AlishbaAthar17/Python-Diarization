# Python-Diarization-Summarization
Python Diarization + Summarization
Also known as speaker diarization, in which audio input is split into different segments or chunks according to the identity of each speaker. In the speech recognition transcript, each speaker's utterances are separated. This code uses Deepgram API for speaker diarization, which requires the use of an API key which you can extract from the Deepgram website. Moreover, each speaker's transcript includes the timestamps and this code also outputs the total time for the whole conversation. After diarization is completed, the code performs speech-to-text functionality in which the entire audio file is outputted, and then with the help of transformers and pipeline, summarization of that text is performed. Transformers is a Python library that makes downloading and training state-of-the-art Machine Learning models easy. It is used for Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, language modeling, summarization, translation, text generation, etc. Moreover, this code also contains commented file handling and a 2-line code of TinyTag that is used to extract useful information from the txt file of the summarized audio which you can adjust according to your preferences.
